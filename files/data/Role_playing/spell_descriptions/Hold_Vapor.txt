This spell allows a wizard to halt and prevent the further movement of any visible cloud or vapor within the spell's range and area of effect.  Such clouds include gaseous breath weapons,  fog cloud, cloudkill, and incendiary cloud as well as the smokey effects of pyrotechnics.  Other objects and creatures can pass freely through this barrier, moving into and out of the gas-filled area.  A volatile gas could be contained by the spell and safely incinerated by tossing a torch through the barrier.
The hold vapor spell will restrain gas clouds even against magical and natural winds.  A creature in gaseous form or airlike form (air elemental djinns, and vampires, for example) can be contained by this spell.  In these cases, the creature being contained is permitted a saving throw vs. spell each round to break through the barrier.  Gaseous creatures cannot transform from their gaseous state when being contained.
The spell lasts for as long as the wizard continues chanting, to a maximum of one hour, at which time the spell fades and the cloud (if it is still there) settles or drifts naturally.  The wizard can move normally during this period, though if silenced or interrupted from chanting for a full round, the spell will fade and the held vapors will be freed.
This spell does not control a cloud of gas, it only contains it and halts its movement.
The material component of the spell is a small balloon or bladder.
