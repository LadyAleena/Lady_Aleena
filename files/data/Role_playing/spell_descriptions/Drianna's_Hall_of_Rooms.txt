By means of this spell, the wizard conjures an extradimensional space, entrance to which can be gained at single point of space on the place from which it was cast. From the entry point, those creatures observing the area see only a faint shimmering in the air, in an area of 4 feet wide and 8 feet high. The caster of this spell controls entry to the hall, and the portal is shut and made invisible behind him when he enters. The caster can open it again from his own side at will. Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they will see a hallway with doors on either side of it. The hallway is 10 feet wide, and has 1+1
level doors. The doors are not locked, but can be from either the inside of the rooms or from the outside, to be determined when the spell is cast. The rooms can be furnished by the caster or not depending on the use of this space. It can be used as a temporary shelter, jail, storehouse, or whatever the caster has in mind. If the rooms are furnished, the furnishings will be only of the basic variety. There is no food in the hallway, but one room can be made into a basic kitchen if the caster wants one. This space can only be entered through its special portal. The outside conditions will not affect the inside of this space.
The material components of this spell are a miniature platinum portal, a miniature door made of a rare wood, and a gemstone of no less than 200 gp in value. To alter the rooms, the caster must incorporate those things (sinks, tubs, fireplaces) as miniatures of the originals made of silver.
Note: This is a unique spell known only to Drianna StrongOak-Guard.
