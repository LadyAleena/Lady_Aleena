The mass suggestion spell enables the wizard to influence the actions of one or more chosen creatures in the same way as the suggestion spell. Up to one creature per experience level of the caster can be influenced, provided that all subject creatures are within the 30-yard range. Undead are not subject to this spell. The suggestion must be reasonably worded and understood by the creatures, and must be the same for all hearing it. Creatures successfully saving vs. spell are unaffected. Saving throws against the spell suffer a penalty of -1, and if a single creature is to be affected, its saving throw suffers a -4 penalty. Note that a very reasonable mass suggestion can cause the saving throw to be made with an additional penalty (such as -1, -2, etc.), at the discretion of your DM. A mass suggestion can continue in effect for a considerable duration, at the DM's discretion. Conditions that will trigger a special action can also be specified; if the condition is not met before the spell expires, the action will not be performed.
The material components of this spell are a snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil.
