When this spell is cast, the wizard causes seven shimmering, multicolored rays of light to flash from his hand in a triangular spray. This spray is 70 feet long and spreads to 15 feet wide at the end. It includes all colors of the visible spectrum; each ray has a different power and purpose. Any creature with fewer than 8 Hit Dice struck by a ray is blinded for 2d4 rounds, regardless of any other effect.
Any creature in the area of effect will be touched by one or more of the rays. To determine which ray strikes a creature, roll 1d8 and consult the following table:
