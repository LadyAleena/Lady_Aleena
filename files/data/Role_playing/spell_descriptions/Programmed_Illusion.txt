This spell creates a spectral force spell that activates upon command or when a specific condition occurs. The illusion has visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements. It can be of any object, creature, or force, as long as it remains within the boundaries of the spell's area of effect.
The occurrence that begins the illusion can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired, such as the following: "Begin only when a venerable female human carrying a sack of groat clusters sits cross-legged within one foot of this spot." Such visual triggers can react to a character using the disguise ability. Command range is 5 yards per level of the wizard, so a 12th-level wizard can command the programmed illusion to occur at a maximum encounter range of 60 yards. A programmed illusion cannot distinguish invisible creatures, nor alignment, level, Hit Dice, or class, except by external garb. If desired, the effect can be keyed to a specific noise or spoken word. The spell lasts until the illusion occurs; thus, the spell duration is variable. The illusion will last for a maximum of one round per level of the spellcaster.
Creatures that attempt to disbelieve the illusion gain a saving throw vs. spell and, if successful, see it for what it is and add +4 bonuses to associates' saving throws, if this knowledge can be communicated effectively. Creatures not sensing the spell effect are immune until they become aware of it. The illusion is subject to a dispel magic spell.
The material component of the spell is a bit of fleece.
