Wielding this spell, an illusionist or wu jen can instantly dispel any illusion or phantasm cast by a wizard of another school. However, against a spell of mixed schools, their own schools, and nonwizard illusions, this spell acts as a dispel magic spell (11 or higher on a 1d20 to dispel, Â±1 per level difference). At the DM's option, this spell may affect items that create illusion and phantasmal effects as well.
