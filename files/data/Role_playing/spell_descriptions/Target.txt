With this spell the wizard marks a person or creature as the target for any missile weapons and missile like spells. The victim's dexterity will not be a factor to hit after the spell is cast. To cast the spell the wizard throws a dagger used by the wizard in combat at least once before at the intended victim. The dagger does maximum damage and the wizard's THAC0 is equal to that of a fighter of the same level for just the first throw. Any daggers or missiles after that will be at the wizard's original THAC0. All other missile weapons in a 10 yard radius from the victim will hit the victim no matter in which direction it was fired or thrown. The victim can save to negate the spell, though the original dagger throw will still do damage if the victim is hit.
The material component is the wizard's dagger used in combat by the wizard at least once before.
