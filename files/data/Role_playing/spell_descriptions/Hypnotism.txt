The gestures of the wizard, along with his droning incantation, cause 1d6 creatures within the area to become susceptible to a suggestion--a brief and reasonable-sounding request (see the 3rd-level wizard suggestion spell). The request must be given after the hypnotism spell is cast. Until that time, the success of the spell is unknown. Note that the subsequent suggestion is not a spell, but simply a vocalized urging (the caster must speak a language the creature understands for this spell to work). Creatures that successfully roll their saving throws are not under hypnotic influence. Those who are exceptionally wary or hostile save with +1 to +3 bonuses. If the spell is cast at an individual creature that meets the caster's gaze, the saving throw is made with a penalty of -2. A creature that fails its saving throw does not remember that the caster enspelled it.
