This spell enables the wizard to conjure a vertical, opaque wall--a shimmering, multicolored plane of light that protects him from all forms of attack. The wall flashes with all colors of the visible spectrum, seven of which have a distinct power and purpose. The wall is immobile, and the spellcaster can pass through the wall without harm. However, any creature with fewer than 8 Hit Dice that is within 20 feet of the wall and does not shield its vision is blinded for 2d4 rounds by the colors.
Each color in the wall has a special effect. Each color can also be negated by a specific magical effect, but the colors must be negated in the precise order of the spectrum. The accompanying table shows the seven colors of the wall, the order in which they appear, their effects on creatures trying to attack the spellcaster, and the magic needed to negate each color.
The wall's maximum proportions are 4 feet wide per level of experience of the caster and 2 feet high per level of experience.  A prismatic wall spell cast to materialize in a space occupied by a creature is disrupted and the spell is wasted.
