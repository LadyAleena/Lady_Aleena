The globe of protection of this spell is identical in all respects to a protection from illusions spell, except that it encompasses a much larger area.  The effect is centered on and moves with the creature touched.
The protection allows those in the area to see through any illusionary attacks and know them for what they are.  The spell provides no protection against phantasms-attacks that exist only in the minds of those protected,  such as phantasmal killer.  It does not counter such magics as invisibility, blur, or projected image, nor does it penetrate illusions that conceal.
