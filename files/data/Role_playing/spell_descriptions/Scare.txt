This spell causes creatures with fewer than 6 Hit Dice or levels of experience to fall into fits of trembling and shaking. The frightened creatures have a -2 reaction adjustment and may drop items held if encumbered. If cornered, they fight, but with -1 penalties to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws.
Only elves, half-elves, and priests are allowed saving throws against this spell. Note that this spell has no effect on the undead (skeletons, zombies, ghouls, and so on), or on upper or lower planar creatures of any sort.
The material component used for this spell is a bit of bone from an undead skeleton, zombie, ghoul, ghast, or mummy.
