A mind fog is a physical block of fog that enables the wizard to weaken the mental resistance of his victims. Victims are allowed a saving throw at a -2 penalty to avoid the effects.
The penalty to saving throws operates cumulatively with any penalties that operate for other reasons. Affected creatures suffer the penalty as long as they remain in the fog and for 2d6 rounds thereafter.
