This spell lets the subject see through any illusionary attack, knowing it for what it is.  Protection from illusion provides no protection against phantasms-attacks that exist only in the mind of the subject, such as phantasmal killer.  It does not counter such magics as invisibility, blur, or projected image, nor does it penetrate illusions that conceal.
