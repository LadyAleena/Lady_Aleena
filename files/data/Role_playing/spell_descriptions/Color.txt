The spell allows a wizard to effect a permanent color change in cloth, leather, or similar substance. The speed at which the change takes place is variable. With a gesture, the caster can instantaneously make an entire piece change to a single hue. If several colors are desired the caster must trace with his fingers the areas he intends to color and picture the desired hue for the area outlined; the color changes accordingly. Any color or shade  can be created, including metallic tints, though the latter cannot actually consist of precious metals. Any color changes must be done with two hours, the spell's maximum casting time. The effect is permanent until dispelled.
