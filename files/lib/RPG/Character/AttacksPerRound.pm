=head1 NAME

B<RPG::Character::AttacksPerRound> returns the amount of attacks characters can make in combat. Most classes receive only 1 attack per round with only B<warriors> and B<chaos wardens> (a new class of my creation) receiving more as they advance in level.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To use this module to return the slots needed, use the following. C<attacks_per_round> is exported by default.

  use RPG::Character::AttacksPerRound;

=head2 Getting attacks per level

To get the number of attacks per round a character has, you will need the character's class and level or experience.

  my $attacks_per_round = attacks_per_round($class, { 'level' => $level });
  my $attacks_per_round = attacks_per_round($class, { 'experience' => $xp });

C<attacks_per_round> will return C<1> for any class other than C<warrior> or C<chaos warden> because that is all your character gets. If you see a fraction returned, it means you get the first number of attacks every two rounds.

=head1 NOTE

Rules used for C<AttacksPerRound> for B<warriors> levels 13 and below are standard, however the levels beyond it are house rules and not in any book.
