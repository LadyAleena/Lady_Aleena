=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Page::Number::Pretty qw(commify round pretty_number);

  # returns 2,468

  my $rounded_number = round(0.2468, 3);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Page::Number::Pretty contains three subroutines that make numbers prettier: C<commify>, C<round>, and C<pretty_number>.

=head2 commify

B<C<commify>> returns a number with commas between every three digits in the number.

The code was found in L<perlfaq5|http://perldoc.perl.org/perlfaq5.html#How-can-I-output-my-numbers-with-commas-added?>.

=head2 round

B<C<round>> rounds a decimal number by a set precision. If you want the number returned with three digits after the decimal, the precision would be set to 3.

  round($number, $precision);

=head2 pretty_number

B<C<pretty_number>> puts commify and round together so you can get rounded numbers with commas.

  pretty_number($number, $precision);

=head1 DEPENDENCY

Page::Number::Pretty depends on L<Exporter>.
