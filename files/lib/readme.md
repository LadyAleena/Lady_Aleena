# Lady Aleena's modules

I wrote these modules for my site, but some were written just for fun. Those that I would like to share on CPAN one day are in **bold** and have POD (Plain Old Documetation).

[Base](/Base): The module that begins the display of my pages. I am currently considering splitting it into two modules.

**[Date](/Date)**: These modules were written for fun and are not used on my site.

**[Fancy](/Fancy)**: These modules were written to allow for more fancy usage of some functions.

**[Fun](/Fun)**: These modules were written for fun and are not used on my site.

[HTML](/HTML): These modules are to print the html for my site.

[RPG](/RPG): These modules were written to help me display my AD&D player characters, however, that project is on indefinite hold. They are not worth sharing as they are for *Advanced Dungeons & Dragons* 2nd Ed., and the current edition is 5.

**[Random](/Random)**: These modules started out as helpers to my [character mutations generator](RPG/CharacterMutation.pm), but it has since grown to include generators for many many more things. It includes a [readme](Random/readme.md) for more information.

[SVG](/SVG): These modules were all written to help me write the [SVGs](../images) for my site and are specific to my needs.

[Util](/Util): These modules are almost all helpers for my site and are very specific to my needs. There are not many in here that I would want to share. Those I may want to share would need new names.

[Xanth](/Xanth): These modules were written to help me display my [Xanth Character Database](../../../Fandom/Xanth/Characters.pl).

[Zodiac](/Zodiac): The Chinese zodiac module here has already been shared on CPAN by Rene Schickbauer with my permission.

I am considering spinning the modules that I would like to share on CPAN off into their own repository.
