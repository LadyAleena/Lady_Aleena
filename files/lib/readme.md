# Lady Aleena's modules

I wrote these modules for my site. The one JavaScript file is for my collapsible site menu mainly.

## The directories and files

[Page](Page): These modules display my site's pages, generate data for specific sections or pages on my site, or are miscellaneous helpers for my site. No modules outside of Page should use any modules inside of Page. If you look at any of these modules and think they could be lightly modified to be made more general, meaning shareable, let me know.

[Fancy](Fancy): These modules were written to allow for more fancy usage of some functions. You can [readme](Fancy/readme.md) for more information.

[Random](Random): These modules started out as helpers to my [character mutations generator](Page/RolePlaying/Character/Mutation.pm), but they have since grown to include generators for many many more things. The data for these modules are in [auto/Random](auto/Random). It includes a [readme](Random/readme.md) for more information.
