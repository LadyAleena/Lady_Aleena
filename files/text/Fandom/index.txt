Welcome to Lady Aleena's somewhat obsessive B<fandom> of various novel, film, and television series. These are notes I have taken about the series I have jotted down over the years and tried to wrest some sense out of by putting them out there for anyone to read. I have an interest in fictional locations and gods. My biggest interest is with A<I<Xanth>|href="Xanth"> by Piers Anthony followed by A<television and film crossovers|href="Crossovers">. A<I<The Belgariad> and I<Mallorean>|href="?page=The+Belgariad+and+Malloreon"> by David Eddings and A<I<The Riftwar>|href="The_Riftwar"> by Raymod E. Feist also interest me.
My notes may not be very organized, but I am trying.
2 Television and film crossovers
B<A<Television and film crossovers|href="Crossovers">> is mostly me checking the crossovers of the Westphall Universe, but it also includes a section on big fake companies that are sometimes used to create crossovers.
2 Family trees
B<A<Fictional family trees|href="Fictional_family_trees">> has family trees from television and film series that I like with big fictional families. There are more big A<families|href="Xanth/index.pl?page=Families"> in Xanth.
2 Xanth
A<B<Xanth>|href="Xanth"> is a series of more than forty novels with over 2,000 A<characters|href="Xanth/Characters.pl"> and many A<species|href="Xanth/index.pl?page=Species">. The novels chronicle the A<events|href="Xanth/index.pl?page=Timeline"> in Xanth spanning almost 100 years.
