These are B<fictional family trees> I have drawn over time. I have also drawn other family trees for various series and A<Xanth families|href="../Xanth/index.pl?page=Families">. Trees are drawn if there are five or more people across two or more generations. Birth order is maintained except when keeping the birth order would make the tree too wide. For instance, Deven Woodcomb in the Bartowski family is the oldest child, but he is farthest right under his parents.
