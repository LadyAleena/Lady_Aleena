The Trickster and Tina McGee from the 1990 I<The Flash> also appear on the 2016 I<The Flash>. I<The Flash> appeared on I<^Supergirl (2015)^> Q<World's Finest>.
Since the birth of the greater Arrowverse, there have been many events to tie the series together.
A live-action Vixen appeared in I<Arrow> Q<Taken>.
Jefferson Pierce, Black Lightning, appeared on I<The Flash> and I<Legends of Tomorrow>.

2 Tying it together
In I<The Lone Ranger> radio series, the character Dan Reid, Jr. was established as the nephew of the Lone Ranger. I<The Green Hornet> radio series episode Q<Too Hot to Handle> established Dan Reid, Jr. was the father of Britt Reid. Both series were created by George W. Trendle and Fran Striker. They would go on to create the two television series, though it is unclear if the relationship between the Long Ranger and Green Hornet made it to those adaptations.
2 Disconnecting from Westphall
Several television series in this continuity have been disconnected from Westphall.
3 Holy defenestration, Batman!
from ABC, NBC, and CBS
On I<^Batman (1966)^> (1966) many actors have stuck their heads out of a window while Batman and Robin were climbing a wall. In rare cases, a character would stick his head out of a window. These are not crossovers by my definition, though others include them.
When Bill Dana stuck his head out of a window, he appeared as A<himself|href="../index.pl#People_not_considered"> not Jose Jimenez from I<The Bill Dana Show>. A<&#9664;|href="?page=Coming+in+to+Westphall#Making_Room" title="Making Room">
I<^The Addams Family (1964)^> (1964) was canceled several months prior to Lurch sticking his head out of a window on I<Batman>.
I<Batman> was set in the 60s, so when Colonel Klink from the World War II era's I<Hogan's Heroes> stuck his head out of a window, he was very out of date. A<&#9664;|href="?page=Coming+in+to+Westphall#Hooterville_and_The_Brady_Bunch" title="Hooterville and The Brady Bunch">
A crossover did not happen when I<^The Green Hornet (1966)^> (1966) and Kato stuck their heads out of a window in season two of I<Batman>. Near the end of season two, there was a crossover when I<The Green Hornet> and Kato appeared on the I<Batman> episodes Q<A Piece of the Action> and Q<Batman's Satisfaction>. I<The Green Hornet> is a nephew of I<The Lone Ranger> in their respective radio shows. The radio shows were by the same company and then made into television series by the same people, so their crossover works.
This continuity is severed from ^TH-DCU^.
3 Two different Dominic Alonzos
It was thought that Dominic Alonzo from I<^Arrow^> Q<The Undertaking> was mentioned on I<^Hawaii Five-0^> Q<Ho'oilina>. However, the Dominic Alonzo from I<Hawaii Five-0> died eight years before the episode Q<Ho'oilina>. With a Dominic Alonzo appearing a year and a half earlier on I<Arrow>, the two men with the same name are not the same man.
