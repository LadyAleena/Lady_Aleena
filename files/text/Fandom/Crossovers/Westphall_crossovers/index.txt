These crossovers are part of the A<Tommy Westphall Universe|href="https://thetommywestphall.wordpress.com" target="new">. Tommy Westphall was a child on ^St. Elsewhere^ who had autism. In the series finale, it was implied that the entire series took place in his imagination.
Westphall does not include film crossovers, but I included them for completeness in some cases.
So far I connected A<Thomas Holbrook's|href="http://www.poobala.com/crossoverlistb.html#byreality" target="new"> groups 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 29 to 34, and 38.
