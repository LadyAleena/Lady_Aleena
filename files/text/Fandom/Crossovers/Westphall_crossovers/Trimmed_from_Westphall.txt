These crossovers have been B<trimmed from Westphall>. They are still part of the Tommy Westphall Universe elsewhere. Some crossover enthusiasts have created crossovers where it does not make much sense. Here are those I consider non-crosses, however there may still be crossovers in these non-crosses.

2 Back to Westphall

3 No News for the Detectives
At first I did not consider the I<Los Angeles Tribune> a crossover; however, after seeing many screen shots, I was convinced the series using it did cross with each other. There is A<news for the detectives|href="?page=Going+out+from+Westphall#News_for_the_Detectives">.
2 Westerns in Crisis
A<The B<Westerns> and the B<I<Arrowverse>>|href="?page=Westerns+in+Crisis"> came together through a surprising link. Both are still disconnected from Westphall, but who knows for how much longer?

2 Hudson University
Some series have been linked from a mention of the fictional A<Hudson University|href="../Big_fake_companies#Hudson_University">. Hudson University is too generic to be considered for a crossover. However, if any of these series have the same logo for Hudson University on something like stationary, I would consider it a crossover. The following series do not cross because of Hudson University.
* I<Murder, She Wrote> A<&#9664;|href="?page=Going+out+from+Westphall#Original_series_crossovers" title"Magnum P.I.">
* I<Degrassi: The Next Generation> Q<Broken Wings>

* I<Beauty &amp; the Beast>
* I<Arrow> A<&#9664;|href="?page=Westerns+in+Crisis#Arrowverse" title="Arrowverse">
* I<The Mysteries of Laura>
* I<Blindspot>

2 I'm not home!
Many series have been linked because of the series I<Hi Honey, I'm Home!>. I<Hi Honey, I'm Home!> takes the characters out of their original continuities and places them into another. Since they are outside their original continuity, they are not the same characters. So the following do I<not> cross with each other or anything above.
* I<The Donna Reed Show> or I<Dennis The Menace> though they did cross.
* I<The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis>
* I<Hazel>
* I<The Munsters> and its spin-offs
* I<My Mother the Car>
* I<The Flying Nun>
* I<Get Smart> A<&#9660;|href="#McHales_U.N.C.L.E._Gets_Smart" title="McHale's U.N.C.L.E. Gets Smart">

3 Two and a Half, Bang!
I<Two and a Half Men> Q<Fish in a Drawer> did not crossover with I<CSI: Crime Scene Investigation>.A<&#9664;|href="?page=Going+out+from+Westphall#CSI" title="CSI"> I<CSI: Crime Scene Investigation> Q<Two and a Half Deaths> did not crossover with I<Two and a Half Men> because Jon Cryer, Charlie Sheen, and Angus Jones appeared as themselves.A<&#9650;|href="../index.pl#People_not_considered" title="people not considered">

I<The Big Bang Theory> spun off I<Young Sheldon>.
2 Other

A crossover between I<^St. Elsewhere^> and I<Julia> was attempted, however, the Dr. Morton Chegley characters were played by two different actors who have a nearly fifty year age difference.
