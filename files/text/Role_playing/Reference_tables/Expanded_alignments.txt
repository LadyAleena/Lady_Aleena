Are there times when you can't choose an alignment for your character with so few choices? That has come to an end. Here are 121 new alignments to choose from. A plus (+) before an alignment means your character is true (alignment). A minus (-) before an alignment means your character is not that alignment. An alignment in parentheses means your character has those tendencies.
This chart has been used for A<alignment tracking|href="http://easydamus.com/alignmenttracking.html" target="new_tab"> that includes new rules for tracking the alignments of your characters.
