This is my I<opinion> about B<drugs and alcohol>. It is only supported by what I have read or heard, so I could be wrong. I am open to others' opinions, though I may not change my mind. If you feel strongly about this issue, please comment below to tell me what you think. You have the power to change my mind, and if you do, I will change what is here accordingly.
I am for keeping all the illegal drugs illegal. I do not want to even talk about them. I do feel that the drinking age should be lowered, and there should be no penalties to parents who want to allow their children to drink in the home as long as there is proper supervision. Because of my early exposure to alcohol, I drink only on rare occasions.

The Food and Drug Administration of the United States really needs to get off its butt and get to work on getting some of the drugs from Europe tested and approved. It is sad some of the comforts of life that Europeans have because of drugs they have had for years aren't here in the U.S.A. yet. Some of the drugs used in Europe are not approved for use in the U.S.A. had been developed here. Isn't it ironic?
