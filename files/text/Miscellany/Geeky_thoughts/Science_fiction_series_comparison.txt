Over the years people have compared some science fiction series to each other. Here is what I have heard.

|* Star Trek                      |Stargate           |Babylon 5
|- Star Trek                      |r2 Stargate SG-1   |r2 &nbsp;
|- Star Trek: The Next Generation
|- Star Trek: Deep Space Nine     |Stargate: Atlantis |Babylon 5
|- Star Trek: Voyager             |Stargate Universe  |Crusade
There have been several more I<Star Trek> series, but the I<Stargate> and I<Babylon 5> franchises are not able to keep up.
